# Hi, I'm Riccardo ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

Hello! I'm Riccardo Andrea Gurzu, a passionate data scientist based in Lisbon, Portugal. With a strong academic foundation and hands-on experience, I am dedicated to harnessing the power of data to uncover insights and drive innovation.

Currently, I am pursuing an MSc in Statistics and Information Management at NOVA IMS, specializing in Risk Analysis and Management. My academic journey has equipped me with a robust understanding of machine learning, deep learning, and financial analytics. My thesis, "Pairs Trading Strategy with a Machine Learning Approach," exemplifies my ability to apply advanced analytics to solve complex problems, choosing the financial field as I'm currently working in an Investment Bank.

But my passions extend beyond the realm of data. I am pianist, finding solace and expression in music. Analog photography allows me to capture the world through a unique eye, blending art with precision. These creative pursuits fuel my analytical mind, fostering a balance between logic and creativity.

Feel free to explore my projects and reach out!


## Projects

### [Pairs Trading Strategy with a Machine Learning Approach](https://github.com/riccardogurzu/pair-trading-strategy)
This project explores enhancing pairs trading strategies using traditional statistical models and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. It involves data collection, cointegration analysis for pairs selection, model training, and backtesting to evaluate performance.

### [Deep Learning for Melanoma Tumor Detection](https://github.com/riccardogurzu/melanoma-tumor-detection)
An academic project that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) developed with the Keras framework to accurately detect and classify melanoma tumors from a dataset of dermoscopic images, aiming to assist in early detection and diagnosis.

### [Market Sentiment Analysis Using NLP](https://github.com/riccardogurzu/stock-market-nlp-prediction)
This project involves developing an NLP model to predict market sentiment based on tweets. The model classifies tweets into Bearish, Bullish, or Neutral categories using machine learning techniques and extensive data preprocessing.

### [Credit Scoring](https://github.com/riccardogurzu/credit-scoring-ml-models/blob/main/README.md)
A project focused on building and evaluating machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Deep Neural Network) to predict the probability of default in credit scoring, using statistical analysis and feature engineering on a credit dataset.

### [Deep Learning for Bankruptcy Prediction](https://github.com/riccardogurzu/comp_bankruptcy)
This project aims to improve bankruptcy prediction using deep learning techniques. It includes data exploration, feature selection, and developing neural network models with hyperparameter tuning, dropout regularization, and early stopping to optimize performance.

### [Algorithmic Trading & Market Microstructure Project](https://github.com/riccardogurzu/algo-trading)
A project centered on developing and analyzing a trend-following trading strategy based on exponential moving averages (EMAs). It involves backtesting the strategy on historical data and evaluating its performance using various financial metrics.

### [Financial Derivatives Project](https://github.com/riccardogurzu/financial-project)
This project focuses on analyzing and hedging a floating rate loan agreement using a 15-year swap contract. It includes estimating loan cash flows, swap pricing, and evaluating alternative hedging strategies to manage interest rate risk.
